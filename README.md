# Cheat release delayed




## Introduction
Azura is a project I started working on around a month ago using [Designer](https://github.com/designer1337)'s CS:GO Cheat base. I've added alot of features and I am finally releasing it.

## FAQ
### Where is the DLL?
You can find the DLL in the [releases](https://github.com/cazamir/Azura/releases) tab, although it is highly recommended to build the source yourself.

### How do I open the menu?
You can open the menu by pressing the "Insert" key on your keyboard. If you cannot find the Insert key on your keyboard, press "FN" + "H" Or Use an [on-screen keyboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/os-features/on-screen-keyboard#enable-on-screen-keyboard).

### How do i un-inject the cheat?
You can un-inject the cheat by pressing the "End" key on your keyboard. If you cannot find the End key on your keyboard, press "FN" + "M" Or use an [on-screen keyboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/os-features/on-screen-keyboard#enable-on-screen-keyboard).
